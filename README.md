# Overview of the project
## Project : Simple Calculator Using Python<br/>
### Objective

Building a simple calculator in Java involves creating a program that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to achieving this:

Simple Calculator
A simple calculator built in Python that performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project is a great starting point for beginners looking to learn about Python programming and user input handling.

# Features
Addition: Adds two numbers.
Subtraction: Subtracts one number from another.
Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
Division: Divides one number by another, with error handling for division by zero.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Installation
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

Save the code provided in a file named calculator.py.

# Usage
Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where calculator.py is saved.

Run the script using Python:

bash
Copy code
python calculator.py
Follow the on-screen prompts to select an operation and input numbers.

# Code Overview
Function Definitions:

add(x, y): Returns the sum of x and y.
subtract(x, y): Returns the difference between x and y.
multiply(x, y): Returns the product of x and y.
divide(x, y): Returns the quotient of x and y, with error handling for division by zero.
Main Function:

Displays the menu of operations.
